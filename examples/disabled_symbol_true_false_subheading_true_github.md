### Descriptions
##### 2a422db9
Allows update commits to be detected by the system.
##### 223c6ecd
Allows commits that are fixes to be detected.
##### 31b21318
So that it is easier to browse the folder's 100s of files.
##### eeb75f31
So that people who work on this are working with the same project.
##### 537ce93e
This goes through every combination and generates an example file.
##### 71e1d283
So that people can use this on NPM
##### c98dca5e
This is what generates the changelogs
##### f79ea73c
Nothing much yet in here. TODO add more to Readme
##### 03a42bd4
Allows people using IDEs based on the Intellij platform to have everything set up
##### 8b8ab47f
This will mean that the first commit will be on a different line to the previous message, and it does not matter for the last commit as it has a header after.
##### 3f118290
So that it doesn't give away TRADE SECRETS ü§ê
##### e2893c62
Was `mergeCommits`, should have been `updateCommits`
##### a05e7673
Should have been `updateCommits`, was `mergeCommits`
##### 0db93166
It wasn't working because one of the values was on the same line as the code block opening.
##### 5af6e59e
Otherwise it would display `***`, we want just `*` in italics.
