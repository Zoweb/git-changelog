# Examples

These are autogenerated examples from the Virtual TRPG repository for every combination of options.

Each file is the option names separated by an underscore. If there is a value 'true', it means that option exists and has no value. If it is 'false', it means that option does not exist.

The order is in the following:
```
--commit-link-generator
--type-mode
--show-id
--long-id
--description
--subheading-use-id
--heading-link-generator
```
