### Descriptions
##### add update commit support
Allows update commits to be detected by the system.
##### add fix commit support
Allows commits that are fixes to be detected.
##### add more info to examples readme
So that it is easier to browse the folder's 100s of files.
##### add codealike file
So that people who work on this are working with the same project.
##### add test/example generator
This goes through every combination and generates an example file.
##### add package.json
So that people can use this on NPM
##### add generator
This is what generates the changelogs
##### add basic readme
Nothing much yet in here. TODO add more to Readme
##### add intellij files
Allows people using IDEs based on the Intellij platform to have everything set up
##### change text newline to be before each commit
This will mean that the first commit will be on a different line to the previous message, and it does not matter for the last commit as it has a header after.
##### change test to use current repository
So that it doesn't give away TRADE SECRETS ü§ê
##### fix using incorrect variable for update commits
Was `mergeCommits`, should have been `updateCommits`
##### fix using wrong variable for update statistics
Should have been `updateCommits`, was `mergeCommits`
##### fix code block not showing everything
It wasn't working because one of the values was on the same line as the code block opening.
##### escape fix symbol
Otherwise it would display `***`, we want just `*` in italics.
