Allows people using IDEs based on the Intellij platform to have everything set up
##### 8b8ab47f
This will mean that the first commit will be on a different line to the previous message, and it does not matter for the last commit as it has a header after.
##### 3f118290
So that it doesn't give away TRADE SECRETS ü§ê
##### e2893c62
Was `mergeCommits`, should have been `updateCommits`
##### a05e7673
Should have been `updateCommits`, was `mergeCommits`
##### 0db93166
It wasn't working because one of the values was on the same line as the code block opening.
##### 5af6e59e
Otherwise it would display `***`, we want just `*` in italics.
