##### [31b21318](commit/31b2131866556049ae926d4abaf2b492a1e2af28?refName=refs/heads/master)
So that it is easier to browse the folder's 100s of files.
##### [eeb75f31](commit/eeb75f31aa45a630b30aff066ffe2f2d81ab4b0a?refName=refs/heads/master)
So that people who work on this are working with the same project.
##### [537ce93e](commit/537ce93e1967e25c3a988f4ce92ec886e7d316eb?refName=refs/heads/master)
This goes through every combination and generates an example file.

This is what generates the changelogs
##### [f79ea73c](commit/f79ea73cdc47fd8cbca8d9013bbc3942c4119f12?refName=refs/heads/master)
Nothing much yet in here. TODO add more to Readme

##### [bf070051](commit/bf070051bdd9fda2101652b5d557c0b748822d02?refName=refs/heads/master)
This forces it to be on a newline, and also allows for more display options for any descriptions.
##### [8b8ab47f](commit/8b8ab47fc4193261506d9fd2e2c9f0f4dfa72f12?refName=refs/heads/master)
This will mean that the first commit will be on a different line to the previous message, and it does not matter for the last commit as it has a header after.
##### [3f118290](commit/3f11829000fba42a4476ca59563ee0460689c958?refName=refs/heads/master)

##### [e2893c62](commit/e2893c627fd66e2ede2eac395812e95162ae0d15?refName=refs/heads/master)

##### [a05e7673](commit/a05e767311e7147fa2647d3e848fc880ea733582?refName=refs/heads/master)

##### [0db93166](commit/0db931663b07b7866c00ba3d7be7c349891cdc78?refName=refs/heads/master)
It wasn't working because one of the values was on the same line as the code block opening.
##### [5af6e59e](commit/5af6e59e002a29ae7bc48cb326e8b5c1d083f67d?refName=refs/heads/master)
Otherwise it would display `***`, we want just `*` in italics.
