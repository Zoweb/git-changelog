##### fix using incorrect variable for update commits
Was `mergeCommits`, should have been `updateCommits`
##### fix using wrong variable for update statistics
Should have been `updateCommits`, was `mergeCommits`
##### fix code block not showing everything
It wasn't working because one of the values was on the same line as the code block opening.
##### escape fix symbol
Otherwise it would display `***`, we want just `*` in italics.
